# Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the
# Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are
# the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

    empty.append(b)
    for i in range(100):
        a,b = b, a+b
        empty.append(b)
